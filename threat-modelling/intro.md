# Intro

## Threat Modelling

It's a security process where potential threats are identified, categorized, and analyzed.

There are two approaches to implementing threat modeling&#x20;

1\) **Proactive Approach:**  Taking necessary control during design and development.

2\) **Reactive Approach**:   Implementing control once the product has been deployed.&#x20;

### Goals of Threat Modeling:

1. To reduce the number of security-related  gaps in coding or Architecture
2. To reduce the severity of remaining Vulnerability

### Identifying Threats

1. Focused on Attackers: Identifying potential attackers and their goals.
2. Focus on Assets: Identifying Threats to valuable assets.
3. Focus on Software: Potential Threats against developed software.

## Threat Modeling Standard

### STRIDE

```

Spoofing: In cyber-security spoofing is an attack when an attacker pretends to be 
someone else.

Tampering: Unauthorised modification, editing, manipulation of data.

Repudiation: Sending proof of identity to recipient and receiver should have
proof of identity of the sender. (Digital Certificate)

Information Disclosure: Disclosure of sensitive information

DOS: Sending an unauthorized large volume of packets, it can be TCP or UDP

Elevation of Privilege: Unauthorized access to a higher level of user, being 
a normal user.

```

## Dread

```
It decides the impact of a threat

Damage Potential: To measure the severity of the damage
Reproducibility: How easy it is to reproduce the exploit 
Exploitability: How easy it is to exploit
Affected User: Number of Users affected by the exploit
Discoverability: How easy it is to find the vulnerability
```
