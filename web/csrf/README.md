# CSRF

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces authenticated users to submit a request to a Web application against which they are currently authenticated. CSRF attacks exploit the trust a Web application has in an authenticated user. A CSRF attack exploits a vulnerability in a Web application if it cannot differentiate between a request generated by an individual user and a request generated by a user without their consent.

## Impact

An attacker’s aim for carrying out a CSRF attack is to force the user to submit a state-changing request, for example

* Submitting or deleting a record.
* Initiating a transaction.
* Purchasing a product.
* Changing a password.
* Sending a message.

## Prerequisites for CSRF

* The success of a CSRF attack depends on a user’s session with a vulnerable application. The attack will only be successful if the user is in an active session with the vulnerable application.
* An attacker must find a valid URL to maliciously craft. The URL needs to have a state-changing effect on the target application.
* An attacker also needs to find the right values for the URL parameters. Otherwise, the target application might reject the malicious request.
