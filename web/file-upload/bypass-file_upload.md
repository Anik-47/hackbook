### Bypassing Blacklists

&#x20;Blacklisting is a type of protection where certain strings of data, in this case, specific extensions, are explicitly prohibited from being sent to the server. At first glance, it might seem like an optimal solution to prevent bad extensions, often executables, from being uploaded, but it is trivial to bypass.

In addition to the regular extensions, there are alternative extensions that can be used to get around blacklist filters. Here are some extensions for PHP files:

```
.pht, .phtml, .php3, .php4, .php5, .php6, .inc
```
